# Daily process

* Morning standup started by yesterday's Taskleader
* Rotating Taskleader, changes each morning according to schedule
* Taskleader reviews yesterday, sets plan for today and goes over any obstacles
* Taskleader leads the meetings and drives the conversation/makes decisions if necessary
* Pair program flexibly; decide ahead of time which tasks will be tackled in pairs
* Record issues that are non-blocking and discuss right after lunch at re-group meeting
* If you are having an issue let folks know after 15-30 min that you are stuck and will ask for help if not done in X amount of time
* At 1:30pm regroup and check-in with blockers, status updates and plan for EOD merge
* Prior to end of day make applicable PRs, review each otherâ€™s code and merge into master
* Only one person needs to sign off on a pull request (but at least one person must sign off on one)

# Team expectations

* Each of us reserves the rights to our nights and weekends
* Brief check-in Sunday evening to make sure everyone feels good about Monday
* Slack first to avoid interrupting, zoom when necessary
* Be available on slack during hours, not necessarily present in zoom room all day (for mental focus and computer capacity reasons)
* Assign tasks vertically
* Share the mic, make sure everyone feels heard
* The more communication, the better
  message the group when you change what you are working on, are significantly stuck, or complete a task

# Issues

* If the group is divided on a certain decision we will take the following steps:
* Take 10-15 minute break
* Vote on it as last resort
* If the vote is split, escalate to a fellow or instructor

* If you are frustrated:
* Take a walk or get some water
* Talk constructively about actionable items (e.g. raise your hand instead of interrupting, let me learn and struggle until I ask you for help, etc.)
* Bring in a 3rd party (e.g. fellow, instructor) to mediate if you feel too frustrated and/or unable to communicate your thoughts
